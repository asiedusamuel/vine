				The term “soul-winning” simply refers to the practice of trying to lead lost sinners to the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation.  Surely, I nor you can save anybody—Only Jesus Christ can save!!!  However, God Almighty has entrusted the job of soul-winning to ALL HIS DISCIPLES.  If you are a saved, born-again Believer, then you are COMMANDED to be a soul-winner.  Listen to the clear teaching of Jesus Christ Himself in Matthew 28:19 and 20, “Go ye therefore, and TEACH ALL NATIONS, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: TEACHING THEM to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.”  It is our duty as Children of God to “teach them.”  Teach who?  We are to teach the Gospel of Christ to lost sinners.  We are to teach those whom we lead to Christ how to win others to Christ.  We are we supposed to teach them.  What do we teach them?  “...to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.”  It was the responsibility of the disciples in Jesus’ day to teach the Gospel to all nations (all people).  If someone became a Believer, accepting Jesus Christ as Almighty God and Savior, then the disciples were to help that new convert grow in the Lord and become a soul-winner also.  This is God’s divine plan to win the lost to Christ—We are responsible!!!

				I am sickened when I hear some dead-beat, backslidden Believer criticize soul-winning.  The Bible praises the soul-winning Christian, “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and HE THAT WINNETH SOULS IS WISE” (Proverb 11:30).  It is wise to win souls to Jesus!  It is wise to go soul-winning!  It is wise to witness to friends, family and strangers concerning the crucified and risen Lord Jesus Christ!  Don’t let the pessimism of fools rob you of your reward in heaven—soul-winning is wise!!!  By the way, the opposite is also true—it is foolish NOT to be a soul-winner—It is foolish to criticize soul-winning—it is foolish NOT to warn your loved ones of the coming day of judgment when they will stand before God.  We read the following words in Mark 16:15, “And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE.”
